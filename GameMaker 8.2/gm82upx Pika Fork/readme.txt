  Version 1.2

Written by renex

This program can compress games made in Game Maker:

- 8.0
- 8.1.91
- 8.1.141
- 8.2

Compression saves filesize and curbs simple decompilation.

Remember however, that the Game Data metafile cannot be compressed, so the gains are only relative to Game Runner compression.


Changes in v1.2
Removed the opening splash screen
Now you can create a file called is.silent and place it next to gm82upx.exe and run it silently without the requirement for user input (useful when running from CLI)
Turned off all of the hotkey settings
